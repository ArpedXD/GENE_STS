/**
 * THE TIMELINE: one ordered list of "beats". Each beat is one scroll stop on the page,
 * and it ties together three things that used to live in three files:
 *
 *   1. a camera pose        (cam)     where the 3D camera stands when this beat is centred
 *   2. a block of copy      (entry)   looked up by id in genomeStudyData
 *   3. an inspectable thing (inspect) the INSPECT key opened by the secondary button
 *
 * dnaScene.js interpolates between CAMERA_KEYS[i] and CAMERA_KEYS[i+1] using the on-screen
 * positions of the stop elements, so the ORDER OF THIS ARRAY IS THE ORDER OF THE FLIGHT.
 * Reorder a beat and its camera, text and button all move together.
 *
 * kind: 'text'   -> floating panel shows the entry's copy
 *       'dark'   -> the pinned DarkSequence (typographic blackout); panel hides
 *       'visual' -> a camera-only beat with no copy; panel hides
 *
 * Pose fields (unchanged from the previous cameraKeys.js):
 *   pos / look     camera position and aim point, world units
 *   roll           tilts the picture
 *   shift          slides the image by a fraction of the viewport (x > 0 pushes the subject RIGHT,
 *                  which is how the panel knows to sit on the LEFT; see panelSide below)
 *   shiftPortrait  same, for phones, where the panel sits below
 *   world          0 = blue DNA world, 1 = warm ant world
 *   dna / ant      how visible each model is
 *   earth          visibility of the planet
 *   forest         visibility of the forest (forest.glb), which sits between the ant and the planet
 *   curve          remaps a parameter's progress inside the segment, so lights go out early and return late
 *   cut            skip the flight: jump to this pose halfway, while the screen is black
 *   morph          the flight INTO this pose is a transformation, not a cut: the planet is born at the ant's
 *                  head (ANT_HEAD) at head size (HEAD_RADIUS), then swells to EARTH_RADIUS while its centre
 *                  sinks to EARTH_ORIGIN. Think of a balloon inflating from a pinpoint: it starts as big as
 *                  the head, grows, and the camera rides the same curve so it hovers just above the skin the
 *                  whole way down. dnaScene.js reads this flag.
